This is a script to build openSUSE Buildservice hosted packages
locally on a computer automatically. It can be hooked in in
Jenkins.

Call it with the tarballs name:
./buildpackage.pl ocsync-0.70.0nightly20120124.tar.bz2

Check buildpackage.ini to see the repo the package come from
and the builds that should happen.

Keys in buildpackage.ini:
The ini group names the package for which the following settings apply.
In the group, the following parameters are valid:
- repo: The repository from which the package is checked out.
- builds: The platforms for which builds are running locally. Leave
          empty if no builds should happen.
- arch:   The architecture for the local builds.
- packagename: An alternative package name.


The script creates some directories in the current directory:
osc_build: The place where the OBS packages are checked out to.
packages:  The locally built bin packages get copied there.
