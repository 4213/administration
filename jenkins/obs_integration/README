This is a script to build openSUSE Buildservice hosted packages 
locally on a computer automatically. It can be hooked in in
Jenkins.

Call it with the tarballs name:
./buildpackage.pl ocsync-0.70.0nightly20120124.tar.bz2

Check buildpackage.ini to see the repo the package come from 
and the builds that should happen. The script creates some
directories in the current directory.
