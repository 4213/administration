genbranding generates package build files such as spec- and deb files from 
templates which can be maintained in a git repository.

genbranding reads OEM.cmake in the theme dir to get values for 
- shortname
- displayname 
- projecturl

Than package.cfg in the same directory as OEM.cmake is read to set the 
other values.
